//! Shared helpers for every `cof` end-to-end test (`e2e_cof.rs`,
//! `e2e_tui_pty.rs`): both need the same temporary `HOME`, stripped
//! credentials, hard timeouts and "nothing survived" check (issue
//! #424's Tests section; #434's pseudo-terminal test reuses it
//! rather than drifting its own copy).
//!
//! A `tests/support/mod.rs` (not a top-level `tests/support.rs`) so
//! Cargo never treats this as its own test binary — only `mod
//! support;` from an actual test file compiles it at all. Each test
//! binary that does gets its own copy, and no one caller uses every
//! function here, hence the blanket `dead_code` allow below rather
//! than one per unused-somewhere item.
